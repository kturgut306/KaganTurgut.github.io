									<h3>Drug Stat</h3>
									<p>"Drug Stat" is my first projects when I was in highschool. We as a team developed "Drug Stat" in 2018 METU Hackathon, which we got 2nd prize. "Drug Stat" is an app which gives an opportunity for evaluating drugs for their origin to doctors or pharmacists. The main idea of this project is supporting Turkish drug producers within equavelent drugs. </p>

									<h3>MemuConverter</h3>
									<p>MemuConverter is my second project based on AI. This project is entry into AI for me. With this project, we were selected one of the top 100 startups by Startup IStanbul in 2019. We were akso selected one of the top 100 startups by Infoshare. However, we could not join the competition. The idea of the project is decreaseing the effort of labeling phase. There are lots of algorithms such as "MemuConverter". For instance, shape and edge algorthims have been using in this field. On the other hand, the algorithm of "MemuConverter" focuses on limiting the treshold. It gives a general overall solution. It devides image into rectengules X length. All of the pixel clusters are assumed as a one pixel. The physical addition of all of the pixels in a cluster is closed to dominant color of that cluster. At the end of this approach, whole clusters rebuild with dominant color of each pixel cluster. The aim is getting rid of undesired little colors. This approach is kind of pixelation but the treshold is not limited in neither pixelation nor edge and shape algorithms.  </p>

									<h3>Educating App</h3>
									<p>We as a team were invited to PennApps in 2019. We developed an app about education. In this app answers are controlled with section by section. For example, failure may be casued becuase of a matematical operation mistake thus, the app will suggest math operation questions not that topic.</p>

									<h3>The Perceptron</h3>
									<p>In 2021, I coded a perceptron to cluster people based on their suspicion about specific diseases such as cancer. The main idea is increasing the participating to cancer screening tests with short questions. Some of the people do not reach their doctor because of several reasons like time issue. However, they feal the early symptoms which is really important especially in cancer. This fealing early symptoms push people to research on the internet etc. In conclusion, this search stage occurs knowhow related to that disease. The main idea is classifying doubts of specific group of people with a perceptron and getting a value 1 to 4. </p>
